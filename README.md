##### 3. Other statistics

Investigation of drugs (csDMARD, TNFi-bDMARD, non-TNFi-bDMARD, MTX, PRED) that affected the abundance of metabolites.

Differentially abundant metabolites related test. 
Investigates whether confounding effects (drug, smoke, age, etc) differs between higher and lower disease activity.
